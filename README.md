## 🏗️ Integration Readiness

This frontend is designed to easily integrate with backend services:

### API Integration Points
```typescript
// Example API integration structure
interface IntegrationEndpoints {
  // User authentication
  auth: '/api/auth',

  // Platform integrations
  internships: '/api/integrations/internships',
  courses: '/api/integrations/courses',
  hackathons: '/api/integrations/hackathons',

  // Verification
  verify: '/api/verify/{type}/{id}',

  // Resume management
  resumes: '/api/resumes',
  export: '/api/resumes/{id}/export',
}
```

### Verification System
The UI already supports verification badges. Backend just needs to provide:
```typescript
interface VerificationResponse {
  verified: boolean;
  source: 'internship' | 'course' | 'hackathon' | 'manual';
  verifiedAt: string;
  verifier: string;
}
```
